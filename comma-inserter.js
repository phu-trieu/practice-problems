// Sometimes, you may be too lazy to add a comma between 0s to separate every
// thousand.If you have your own converter that will just print out a number with
// commas in right position you'd be happy! Today, write a function that converts
// numeric strings to comma-separated strings. â€» However, do not use the money
// conversion library supported by the programming language.

// For example, 2000 -- > 2, 000 | -1224.10 -- > -1, 224.10

const commaInserter = str => {

}

console.log(commaInserter('2000'));
