// Its raining...words ? We need to collect words into our buckets! Let's try to
// write a function that splits a sentence into buckets of words. Each bucket can
// have a provided number of characters or less (spaces count as one character).
// If the whole sentence is unable to fit inside buckets, then we have to return
// an empty array :( Here is an example:

// collectWords("the mouse can creep", 10)
// âžž["the mouse", "can creep",]

const collectWords = (str, num) => {

}

console.log(collectWords("the mouse can creep", 10));
