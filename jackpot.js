// Due to the fact that everywhere - including your favorite casino - is closed
// during the COVID pandemic, you decide to do some online gambling.Lucky for you,
// there is a major flaw in their system, and you can easily hit the jackpot - you
// just need to write a function to do so.This function should take in an array
// (each array element represents a slot item) and return true if all of the elements
// are the same.For example isJackpot(["@", "@", "@", "@"] will return true.If you
// want to win the jackpot, you just need to call the function with matching elements.
// Get ready, because Virtual Vegas Part 2 won't be as easy ;)

const jackpot = array => {
  const check = currentValue => currentValue === array[0];
  return array.every(check);
}

jackpot([1,1,1,1,1]);
