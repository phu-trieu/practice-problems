// Write a function that does the following for the given values: add, subtract,
// divide and multiply.This is simply referred to as the basic arithmetic operations.
// The variables have to be defined, but in this challenge, it will be defined for you.
// All you have to do, is to check the variables, do some string to integer conversion,
// use some if conditions, and apply the arithmetic operation.

// The numbers and operation are given as a string and should result to an integer value.

//   Examples
// operation("1", "2", "add") ➞ 3

// operation("4", "5", "subtract") ➞ -1

// operation("6", "3", "divide") ➞ 2
// Notes
// The numbers and operation are given as a string and should result to an integer value.
// If the operation results to Infinity, then return "undefined"(e.g.division by zero).
// Division results will be rounded down to its integral part.

const operation = (a, b, op) => {

}

console.log(operation('1', '2', 'add'));
