// I'm sure by now you know that computers operate in binary, right? Just a whole
// bunch of 0s and 1s. These are very powerful numbers. A computer's processor is
// made up of circuits that are composed of billions of transistors - switches that
// are activated by the electronic signals it receives.The 1s and 0s reflect each
// on and off state of a transistor.

// Can you write a function that accepts a string of 0s and 1s and returns true if
// every consecutive sequence of 1s is followed by a consecutive sequence of 0s of
// the same length.

// For example:

// 111000110010 -- > true

// 1001101110 -- > false

const onesAndZeros = str => {
  const one = true;
}

console.log(onesAndZeros('111000110010'));
