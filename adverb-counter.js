// An adverb is typically any word that ends in 'ly'.Can you write a function that
// counts the number of words that ends in 'ly'.For this problem, even if the word
// is an adjective, it's still okay to count it as true. However, you must not count
// the word if it starts or contains 'ly' - it MUST be at the end. Happy coding!
