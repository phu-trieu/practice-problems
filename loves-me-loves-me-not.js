// You've most likely heard of the game Loves me, loves me not. Someone has a flower -
// each time the pluck off a petal, they say "Loves me"...then the next time they
// pluck off a flower, they say "Loves me not"... and so on and so on until they pull
// off the last petal. Whatever phrase they speak out when they pull off the last petal
// determines whether someone they have interest in loves them back or not.

// Write a function to simulate this game! Pass in a number of petals.Return "Loves
// me, Loves me not, Loves me...etc".On the LAST phrase, write it in ALL CAPS.

//   doYouLoveMe(4) ==> "Loves me, Loves me not, Loves me, LOVES ME NOT"

const lovesMeLovesMeNot = petals => {
