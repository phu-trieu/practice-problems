// Let's refresh one of the most basic and famous algorithm topics - Binary Search.
// Here's a fundamental search challenge for you to tackle! Binary search algorithms
// are often efficient, and they work by repeatedly dividing the list in half and
// working with the portion that may contain the item being looked for until the
// possible location is narrowed down to just one element.Try giving it a shot!
